Bujangganong (Ganongan) or Patih Pujangga Anom is an energetic, humorous character who is also skilled in martial arts, so his every appearance is eagerly awaited by the audience, especially children. Bujang Ganong depicts a young prime minister who is agile, strong-willed, clever, humorous, and powerful.
The character Pujangga Anom, also known as Kelana Wijaya, Jaka Pujan, Gendruwan, and Bujang Ganong, is recognized as the opposite of the character Jaka Bagus. This character is ugly, with a face like a gendruwo, a type of ghost with a terrifying appearance. This character's physical appearance is short in stature, with a bumpy head, buck teeth, a hooked nose, bulging eyes, a receding forehead, and dreadlocks. His body is medium-sized, rather short, with small hands and a flat chest. When he walks, he shuffles, far from looking gallant. This character is reminiscent of the character Gareng in the Punakawan episode. Nevertheless, Bujang Ganong became a key figure for the central character, Kelana Sewandana. He was entrusted by Sang Prabu Tubagus to propose to Dewi Sangga Langit in Kediri. With his supernatural powers, Kelana Wijaya, as his name suggests, Wijaya, Bujang Ganong proved victorious in subduing Singa Barong, also known as Singo Lodra, who was known to be unmatched in his powers.
