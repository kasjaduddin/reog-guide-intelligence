Jathil or Jathilan is a mounted soldier and one of the characters in Reog art. Jathilan is a dance that depicts the agility of mounted soldiers training on horseback. This dance is performed by dancers who pair up with each other. The agility and skill in fighting on horseback is shown through the dancers' expressions. Jathilan was originally danced by gentle, handsome men or men who resembled beautiful women. The dance movements were also more feminine. Since the 1980s, when the Reog Ponorogo art troupe was sent to Jakarta for the opening of the Jakarta Fair, the jathilan dancers were replaced by female dancers on the grounds that they were more feminine. The characteristics of the Jathilan dance movements in the Reog Ponorogo art form tend to be graceful, agile, and flirtatious. This is supported by the rhythmic pattern of the dance movements, which alternate between the mlaku (naive) and ngracik rhythms.
