Klono Sewandono, or King Kelono, was a powerful and magical king who possessed a powerful heirloom called Cemeti, also known as Kyai Pecut Samandiman. Wherever the king went, he always carried this heirloom with him. The heirloom was used to protect him. The king's bravery is depicted in his agile and authoritative dance movements. In one story, Prabu Klono Sewandono succeeded in creating a beautiful art form. This was the result of his creativity in response to the request of the Princess (his lover). Because the King was intoxicated with love, his dance movements sometimes depicted a person who was in love.
