Klono Sewandono
Klono Sewandono, also known as King Kelono, is a powerful ruler possessing a sacred weapon called Kyai Pecut Samandiman, a mystical whip that he always carries wherever he goes. This heirloom serves as a means of protection for the king. His gallantry and charisma are portrayed through graceful and dignified dance movements. In one story, King Klono Sewandono is said to have created a beautiful art form as an expression of love for his beloved princess. Being deeply enamored, his dance movements often reflect the emotions of a man in love.

Jathil
Jathil, or Jathilan, represents horsemen warriors and is one of the important figures in the Reog performance. The Jathilan dance depicts the agility and skill of mounted soldiers during training. It is performed in pairs, symbolizing harmony and coordination in battle. The dancers express the elegance and bravery of warriors through dynamic yet refined movements. Originally, Jathilan was performed by young men with delicate features—handsome and graceful, resembling beautiful women—hence the dance style appeared rather feminine.
Since the 1980s, when the Reog Ponorogo troupe was invited to perform at the Jakarta Fair (Pekan Raya Jakarta), the Jathilan role has been performed by female dancers to better emphasize its feminine characteristics. The distinctive movements of Jathilan are smooth, lively, and flirtatious, supported by alternating rhythmic patterns between the mlaku (plain) and ngracik (lively) tempos.

Warok
The term Warok comes from the word wewarah, meaning one who gives moral guidance and protection selflessly. A Warok is described as wong kang sugih wewarah—a person rich in wisdom—who teaches others about how to live a virtuous life. In Javanese philosophy, Warok iku wong kang wis purna saka sakabehing laku lan wis meneng ing rasa, meaning a Warok is someone who has achieved spiritual maturity and inner peace.
The figure of the Warok represents the soul and identity of the Ponorogo people, embodying integrity, discipline, and moral strength passed down from ancestors to future generations. In Reog Ponorogo performances, the Warok is an essential character whose presence cannot be separated from the other figures within the ensemble.
