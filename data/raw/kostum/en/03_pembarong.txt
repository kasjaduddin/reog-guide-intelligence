Singo Barong is the dancer character with the head of a Javanese tiger decorated with peacock feathers. The performer moves by swinging the tiger head back and forth, rolling on the ground, and lowering it dramatically. This character serves as the most iconic and symbolic figure of Reog Ponorogo, wearing a massive mask called Dadak Merak.
The property used by Singo Barong is a large lion head mask adorned with peacock feathers, reaching a height of about 1–2 meters above the head.
