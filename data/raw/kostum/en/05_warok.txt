The Warok character appears in Reog performances as a warrior and guardian. The Warok dancer is typically portrayed with a red-painted face, thick beard, and dressed entirely in black attire called penadon, accompanied by a white or red waistband known as kolor or usus-usus. In Reog performances, Warok figures serve as the guards (punggawa) of King Klono Sewandono, consisting of both young and elder Warok.
Young Warok are depicted as strong men training in martial arts, with muscular bodies, hairy chests, thick mustaches, and sharp eyes. Meanwhile, the elder Warok are shown as mentors or overseers, characterized by a thin body, long white beard, and a walking stick.
Properties used by Warok include:
 Black kombor trousers, black shirt, jarit, stagen, epek timang, kolor, udeng, jinjen and tapak doro, debleng mondholan, waktung, keris (dagger), and long-sleeved white shirt.
