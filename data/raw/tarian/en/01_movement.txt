The movements in the art of Reog Ponorogo showcase a combination of agility, strength, and symbolic expression that reflects the character of the Ponorogo people. Each character has a distinctive movement style that contributes to the dynamic nature of the performance. The movements of the warriors depict battle training through firm stances, kicks, and whip swings synchronized with the rhythm of the music. Bujang Ganong performs lively and energetic movements such as squatting (mendhak), jumping, spinning, rolling, and even somersaulting, accompanied by dramatic and humorous facial expressions. Meanwhile, the Barongan displays powerful and bold movements that represent courage and masculinity, while the kendang (drum) player moves with a bowed posture as if bearing the heavy burden of a long journey.
Dancing the dhadak merak requires both a pushing and pulling style. A pushing style is a style that arises from the movement of pushing an object.  Meanwhile, a pulling force is a force that results from pulling an object. So, when we pull or push, we exert a force on the object.  During the dadak merak dance performance, the reog dancers hold the dadak merak from end to end, then push the dadak merak forward while fluttering it to create movement in the dhadak merak.  After that, the dancer pushes his body to the ground and turns his body with the dadak merak still facing upwards or forwards. Another movement is when the reog dancer pulls their body backward (kayang) with the dadak merak facing upward and then tries to stand up without assistance.  These movements are basic movements that every dadak merak dancer must master. However, usually, if they have special skills, the movements they perform will be more extreme and interesting.
