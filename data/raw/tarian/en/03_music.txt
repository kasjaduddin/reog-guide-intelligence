The entire Reog performance is accompanied by traditional music that enhances its magical and heroic atmosphere. Instruments such as the gong, kendang (drum), and angklung blend together to create rhythms that harmonize with the dancers’ movements. The musical accompaniment not only sets the tempo and emphasizes emotions but also serves as a vital element in building the dramatic and sacred ambiance that characterizes the Reog Ponorogo performance.
