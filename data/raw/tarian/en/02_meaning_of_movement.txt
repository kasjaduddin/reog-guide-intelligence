Behind each movement, Reog carries profound philosophical meanings. The dance symbolizes the bravery, strength, and fighting spirit of the people in facing life’s challenges. It also conveys a moral message, reminding leaders not to be easily swayed by desire or negative influence that could lead them astray. The epic story of war between the Kingdoms of Bantarangin and Daha depicted in the performance reflects values of heroism, responsibility, and the pursuit of noble goals through honorable means. Reog also serves as a symbol of Ponorogo’s cultural identity, passed down from generation to generation, teaching the values of unity and mutual cooperation as expressions of social harmony.
