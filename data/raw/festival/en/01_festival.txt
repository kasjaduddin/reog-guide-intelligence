The National Reog Ponorogo Festival (FNRP) is an annual cultural event that showcases the traditional art of Reog Ponorogo, which has been recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The festival serves as the main highlight of the Grebeg Suro celebration, which coincides with the Islamic New Year (1 Muharram) and the anniversary of Ponorogo Regency.
Since its establishment in 1995, FNRP has become a prestigious competition for Reog performance groups from across Indonesia—and even from abroad—to compete for the President of the Republic of Indonesia’s Trophy. The entire series of events is centered at Alun-Alun Ponorogo (Ponorogo Town Square), which is adorned with monuments and symbols representing Reog legends such as Dewi Songgolangit and Prabu Klono Sewandono.
In addition to the main performances, the festival features various supporting activities held throughout an entire month, including art exhibitions, religious traditions, crafts, sports events, culinary fairs, and MSME (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) showcases. One of its notable sub-events is the Youth Reog Festival (FRR), dedicated to junior high school students (SMP/MTs) who compete for the Ponorogo Regent’s Trophy.
Carrying the theme “Through the Implementation of FNRP, Realizing a Creative, Innovative, and Collaborative Tourism Development Towards a Great Ponorogo”, the festival plays a vital role in preserving Reog art, strengthening the local economy, and enhancing tourism appeal through collaboration among artists, communities, MSMEs, and the people of Ponorogo.
