Reog art has now spread throughout Indonesia. Almost every regency in East Java has its own Reog troupe, and communities can also be found outside Java, including in Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Bali. Ponorogo migrants play a major role in keeping this tradition alive wherever they live. Reog has become a symbol of cultural unity that connects people across regions and generations.
