There is no specific dress code for attending a Reog performance. Visitors are encouraged to wear modest and comfortable clothing, especially for outdoor events. During major celebrations such as Grebeg Suro, many locals wear traditional Ponorogo batik as a sign of respect for their culture. Comfortable footwear is recommended, as performance areas can be large and crowded.
