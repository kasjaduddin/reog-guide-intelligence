Visitors are allowed to take photos and videos during Reog performances as long as it doesn’t disturb the show. Using flash is discouraged, as it can distract the dancers. For professional or commercial documentation, it’s recommended to ask permission from the event organizers. Capturing Reog moments is a great way to share Ponorogo’s culture with the world, as long as it’s done respectfully.
