The best place to watch a Reog Ponorogo performance is at the Ponorogo Town Square (Alun-Alun Ponorogo), especially during the National Reog Festival held every Suro (the Javanese New Year). In addition, many Reog communities, both in Ponorogo and outside the region, regularly stage Reog performances. Several tourism villages such as Jabung and Kauman also often organize shows for visitors.
