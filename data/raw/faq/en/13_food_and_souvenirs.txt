One of Ponorogo’s most well-known delicacies is jenang, a sweet dish made from rice flour, coconut milk, and palm sugar. Jenang is commonly served at traditional ceremonies or bought as a souvenir. Visitors can also find local crafts such as leather goods, miniature Reog masks, and Ponorogo batik with designs inspired by the lion and peacock motifs. Each product reflects the artistic spirit and creativity of the local community.
