Reog Ponorogo has distinctive features that set it apart from other traditional arts in East Java. The performance highlights the massive Singa Barong mask adorned with peacock feathers, along with the Warok character rich in philosophical meaning. This contrasts with Ludruk, which emphasizes humorous dialogues and folk stories, or Wayang Kulit, which focuses on epic tales from the Mahabharata and Ramayana. Meanwhile, Jaranan showcases mystical horse dances, while Reog emphasizes physical strength, bravery, and striking visual beauty. These differences make Reog Ponorogo unique and easily recognized as a cultural icon of East Java.
