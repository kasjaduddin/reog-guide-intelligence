The origins of Reog itself began with Ki Ageng Kutu's satire of the Majapahit King Prabu Brawijaya V. The last king of Majapahit was considered weak because he was too submissive to the will of his queen, so he was unable to rule the kingdom as well as his predecessors. The chaotic situation in the palace made the servants anxious, but the king's power was too great for them to dare to offer advice. One of the advisors, Ki Ageng Ketut Suryo Alam, finally left Majapahit for the village of Kutu in Wengker. There, he established a hermitage to train his students in martial arts, shaping them into true knights. Ki Ageng Kutu satirized the condition of Majapahit through the art of Reog, using meaningful symbols: warok as a respected elder, Singo Barong as a satire of an arrogant king, graceful jathilan symbolizing the decline of military spirit, and the wise but unappreciated Bujang Ganong.
With the end of Ki Ageng Kutu's reign in Wengker and the beginning of Raden Bathoro Katong's reign in Ponorogo, Reog was perfected and elevated to become the original art of Ponorogo. This refinement can be seen in the addition of a tiger head symbol decorated with a peacock tail and a beak carrying a beaded necklace, which represents a tool for prayer, namely a tasbih. Reog as a cultural art became a medium for preaching in the spread of Islam in Ponorogo, in line with the policy of the Wali Songo in their efforts to spread Islam throughout Indonesia, especially in Java. During the reign of Bathoro Katong, Reog art was considered necessary to preserve as an effective tool for uniting and gathering people, as well as a medium for direct information and communication with the community. The Gamelan music, which was originally used by Ki Ageng Kutu to accompany contests of strength and supernatural powers, was used by Raden Bathoro Katong to attract the community. When the community began to gather, Raden Bathoro Katong began to teach them about Islam.
