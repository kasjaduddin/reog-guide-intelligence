It is told that there once lived a princess whose beauty shone like that of a celestial goddess. Her name was Dyah Ayu Dewi Songgolangit, the daughter of the King of Kediri. Her beauty became renowned across the lands and reached the ears of Prabu Kelana Sewandana, the powerful ruler of the Kingdom of Bantarangin. Upon hearing of her extraordinary beauty, the king became deeply intrigued and fell in love with her. Driven by this affection, Prabu Kelana Sewandana sent his loyal prime minister, Pujangga Anom, better known as Bujang Ganong, to propose marriage to Dyah Ayu Dewi Songgolangit. Thus, Bujang Ganong set out on his journey to the Kingdom of Kediri.
On his way, Bujang Ganong was confronted by Singobarong, the king of all tigers and guardian of the Kediri border, also known as Lodaya. Singobarong had a peculiar form—a human body with the head of a tiger. It was said that he had been ordered by the King of Kediri to forbid anyone from entering the kingdom without permission. Bujang Ganong’s journey was halted when he encountered Singobarong. A heated argument ensued between the two warriors, which soon escalated into a fierce battle. Due to Singobarong’s immense strength and magical power, Bujang Ganong was defeated and forced to kneel before him. Singobarong then ordered Bujang Ganong to return to Bantarangin and report his failure. Reluctantly, the loyal minister returned empty-handed and reported everything to his king.
Hearing of his envoy’s defeat, Prabu Kelana Sewandana was enraged. He immediately commanded Bujang Ganong to mobilize the army and prepare for war against Singobarong and the Kingdom of Kediri. Bujang Ganong gathered his generals and trained the Bantarangin soldiers in preparation for battle. Meanwhile, Prabu Kelana Sewandana was filled with anger and curiosity toward Singobarong, who had managed to defeat his intelligent, agile, and powerful minister.
The next day, after completing their battle preparations, the Bantarangin army marched toward the border of Kediri, still bearing the sting of their previous defeat. Accompanied by the beating of gongs and war drums meant to raise morale, Prabu Kelana Sewandana led his troops with a burning determination. In his heart, he vowed to destroy Kediri should Dewi Songgolangit reject his proposal. As before, when they reached the Kediri border, they were intercepted once again by Singobarong and his troops.
A fierce battle broke out. The forces of Singobarong proved difficult to overcome, compelling Prabu Kelana Sewandana himself to engage in combat. A duel of great power ensued between the two mighty kings. Both possessed extraordinary strength and mystical abilities. Eventually, Prabu Kelana Sewandana drew his legendary weapon, the Samandiman Whip. With a single strike, Singobarong was defeated and rendered powerless. Accepting his loss, Singobarong pledged loyalty to Prabu Kelana Sewandana, who agreed to spare him on the condition that he guide the way to the Kingdom of Kediri and assist in fulfilling his mission.
The two armies then united under the command of Singobarong and Bujang Ganong, advancing together toward Kediri. With Singobarong’s help, Prabu Kelana Sewandana successfully reached the royal city and was granted an audience with the King of Kediri. There, he expressed his intention to marry Dyah Ayu Dewi Songgolangit. As fate would have it, the princess also held affection for Prabu Kelana Sewandana, and the King of Kediri gave his blessing for their union. Prabu Kelana Sewandana finally married Princess Dyah Ayu Dewi Songgolangit. To commemorate his journey and victory, an art form was created — the Reog performance, now known as Reog Ponorogo.
