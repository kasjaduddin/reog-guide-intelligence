Reog Ponorogo has undergone several changes over time. At least, Reog Ponorogo can be divided into Reog festival, Reog obyogan, and Reog mini. As a product of art and culture, Reog needs to be preserved. Therefore, various efforts have been made by the local government to conserve Reog Ponorogo. In this case, the government has carried out revitalization, reinterpretation, and symbolic expression. To revitalize Reog Ponorogo, the government invited Reog artists to work together in realizing it as a cultural product. Thus, Reog mini and several crafts, as well as miniatures of Reog Ponorogo, were born.
Furthermore, the government and artists also reinterpret and symbolically express Reog Ponorogo, such as in the Grebeg Suro Festival. In this festival, the government and artists hold a number of competitions in the Reog performance. In this performance, participants are free to express all forms of inspiration and aspirations but must not deviate from the established rules. To make it legally binding, the local government has issued decree number: 188.45/101/405.13/2014. This annual event aims to improve the people's economy and help preserve the region's cultural potential in supporting tourism in Ponorogo Regency. The Grebeg Suro Festival is very important for the people of Ponorogo because it is an annual event held every 1 Muharram (1 Suro in the Javanese calendar) and aims to preserve the noble values of the nation's culture, namely Reog Ponorogo, which is a traditional art form originating in Ponorogo. With this annual festival, it is hoped that all Indonesians and foreigners will understand that Reog is an art form native to Ponorogo. 
Meanwhile, Reog Obyogan is an art form that thrives in rural areas but has strayed far from the traditional Reog Ponorogo. The performances can be held in yards, village intersections or junctions, and in cemetery courtyards. The difference between Reog Obyogan and traditional Reog is in the formation of the performers, the music, and the venue. Reog Obyogan does not feature the characters Kelana Sewandhana and Warok. This Reog only features Dhadak Merak, Jathilan, and Bujang Ganong. These three characters have always been an attraction for the community, with the hope of getting many continuous performance bookings so that, from an economic and business perspective, they can attract a lot of capital and material (money).
Meanwhile, mini Reog is a Reog performance that closely resembles traditional Reog, starting from the characters played, the music, and so on. The difference is that this Reog is performed by children and teenagers. This is an effort by artists and the government to preserve the arts for the younger generation. Another difference is that the Dhadak Merak masks used in mini Reog are minimalist (small) in size because all the characters in this performance are played by children. 
The development of Reog today cannot be separated from the government's efforts to preserve its cultural heritage. The hope is that the next generation will not only enjoy this performance but also participate in preserving it. In 2019, the regent of Ponorogo issued Regent Instruction No. 556/582/405.08/2019 to hold simultaneous Reog performances in all villages in the Ponorogo district on July 11 every year.
