The Reog Ponorogo artisans are micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that play a vital role in preserving traditional arts while supporting the growth of the regional creative economy. They produce a variety of distinctive Reog performance equipment, such as barongan or dadak merak masks, dancer costumes, and gamelan musical instruments. This production activity serves not only as a means of cultural preservation but also as a primary source of livelihood for the local community.
With the growing popularity of Reog Ponorogo as both a national and international tourism attraction, Reog handicrafts now hold increasingly promising economic prospects. Local artisans’ products have even been successfully exported to various countries, including Australia, Belgium, Germany, France, Japan, Malaysia, Madagascar, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the United States (Wijayanto et al., 2021). This development provides new hope for the advancement of the Reog handicraft industry while strengthening Ponorogo’s image as a center of traditional culture with global competitiveness (Kristiyana & Rapini, 2017).
The wide range of handicraft products reflects the artisans’ creativity and precision:
* Ganongan Mask:
 The ganongan mask represents the character Bujang Ganong, known for his agility and high energy. The mask is predominantly red, symbolizing spirit and enthusiasm, adorned with long black-and-white hair or feathers. In its miniature form, it is also produced as children’s toys or souvenirs, measuring about 15–30 cm in size.

* Reog Ponorogo Gamelan Set:
 This is a set of traditional musical instruments used to accompany Reog performances, including angklung reog, terompet reog, kongkil, kendang, saron, gong, and kempul. The angklung reog has a distinctive feature—a tuft of red and yellow tassels on top that adds aesthetic value without changing the way it is played.

* Dadak Merak:
 The most iconic element of the Reog performance, dadak merak is a large mask featuring a lion’s head topped with magnificent peacock feathers. Weighing up to several tens of kilograms, it symbolizes the strength and endurance of the dancer who bears it. The natural beauty of the peacock feathers enhances its grandeur and serves as a symbol of pride for the people of Ponorogo.

* Reog Ponorogo Costume:
 The dancers’ costumes are dominated by black and red colors, symbolizing courage and the spirit of struggle. The combination of a black outfit, red undershirt, and black pants creates a bold and harmonious appearance that complements the heroic theme of the Reog story.

The Reog Ponorogo handicraft MSMEs not only contribute to the preservation of traditional art but also make a tangible impact on the regional economy by creating employment opportunities for artisans, tailors, and small business owners. Support for quality improvement, digital marketing, and collaboration with cultural communities and the tourism sector are key strategies to strengthen and sustain the Reog handicraft industry in the modern era.
