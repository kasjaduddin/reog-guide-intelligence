According to Hatib Abdul Kadir in his book Tangan Kuasa dalam Kelamin (2007), the dance drama known as Reog once greatly unsettled the government of its time because it was seen as a form of satire directed at the ruling power. The figure of Singobarong symbolizes the strength of the jungle king embodied by Kertabumi, while the peacock perched on top represents Kertabumi’s subjugation under his wife’s influence. The female horse figure (kuda kepang) symbolizes Kertabumi’s weakness. Due to this satirical portrayal, the Majapahit Kingdom eventually banned the performance of this art.
The belief that sexual relations with women could grant power was reflected in a legend where a small group of Warok warriors successfully defeated Bre Kertabumi’s army in battle. The Warok were regarded as central and powerful figures, capable of overcoming the king’s forces.
